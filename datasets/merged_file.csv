Since an email can have any number of recipients, a single email is mapped to multiple edges in this dataset, resulting in the number of edges in this network being about twice the number of emails in the dump.;",,Email Networks,Person,Email communication,,TRUE,,,,,,,,,1900,,,37400,,,,,,5500,,,40,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,-0.153642,,,,,,,,,24700000,,6.29305,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0.0214827,1,635

The authors collaboration network in computational geometry was produced from the BibTeX bibliography [Beebe, 2002] obtained from the Computational Geometry Database geombib, version February 2002 [Jones, 2002]. Two authors are linked with an edge, iff they wrote a common work (paper, book, ...). The value of an edge is the number of common works. Using a simple program written in programming language Python, the BibTeX data were transformed into the corresponding network, and output to the file in Pajek format. The obtained network has 9072 vertices (authors) and 22577 edges (common papers or books) / 13567 edges as a simple network - multiple edges between a pair of authors are replaced with a single edge. The problem with the obtained network is that, because of non standardized writing of the author's name, it contains several vertices corresponding to the same author. For example: R.S. Drysdale, Robert L. Drysdale, Robert L. Scot Drysdale, R.L. Drysdale, S. Drysdale, R. Drysdale, and R.L.S. Drysdale; or: Pankaj K. Agarwal, P. Agarwal, Pankaj Agarwal, and P.K.

The_Edinburgh_Associative_Thesaurus,http://vlado.fmf.uni-lj.si/pub/networks/data/dic/eat/Eat.htm,"The Edinburgh Associative Thesaurus (EAT) is a set of word association norms showing the counts of word association as collected from subjects. This is not a developed semantic network such as WordNet (3), but empirical association data. The traditional way to collect word association norms is to show or say a word to several people and ask them to say the word which first comes to their minds upon receiving the stimulus. The link established between the stimulus and the response is not semantically labelled (e.g. as synonym, antonym or by a case relation) and can only be regarded as an association. The Edinburgh association norms were collected by growing the network from a nucleus set of words. Responses were collected to words in this nucleus set, then these responses were used to obtain further responses, and so on. In fact the cycle was repeated about three times since by then the number of different responses was so large that they could not be re-used as stimuli. Data collection stopped when 8400 stimulus words had been used. Each stimulus word was presented to 100 different subjects, each of whom received 100 words. This gave rise to a total of 55732 nodes in the Thesaurus network. The subjects were mostly undergraduates from a wide variety of British universities. The age range of the subjects was from 17 to 22 with a mode of 19. The sex distribution was 64 per cent male and 36 per cent female. The data was collected between June 1968 and May 1971. The database consists of two files. The SR (stimulus-response) file, and the RS (response-stimulus) file. Where words have been truncated to 19 characters to save space the per cent character (%) has been placed as the 20th.

ERC20-stablecoins,https://snap.stanford.edu/data/ERC20-stablecoins.html,"This dataset was provided by Jason Zhu and Cuneyt G. Akcora from U Manitoba, and Murat Kantarcioglu and Yulia Gel from UT Dallas. Stablecoins are special tokens that are meant to maintain a fixed price value (e.g., 1 USD per token) over time by being pegged to a fiat currency. Stablecoins are used as a safe house from the volatility that standard cryptocurrencies experience. The dataset contains ERC20 transaction data of the top five stablecoins in market cap (USDT, USDC, DAI, UST, PAX) and WLUNA. Wrapped LUNA (WLUNA) is not a stablecoin, but it is a form of the LUNA classic token mined and traded on the Ethereum blockchain. Each transaction in the data comprises the quantity of the respective stablecoin defined by the contract address in its row, transferred between various Ethereum externally owned addresses or smart contracts. The dataset contains over 70 million transactions, split into three files, from blocks 14500001 (Friday, April 1, 2022 11:10:21 AM GMT) to 15872937 (Tuesday, November 1, 2022 4:53:59 AM GMT) which span approximately a period of one month before the crash to six months after the crash. The dataset includes three different versions of the networks, each with a longer time length than the previous one. The longest version, identified as token_transfers_V3.0.0.csv, has the greatest time span. The dataset also includes the price data which contains UTC time zone price data (open, high, low, close) in USD of each stablecoin (USDT, USDC, DAI, UST, PAX) and WLUNA from April 1 2022 to November 1 2022. All price data were obtained from Coin Market Cap. Finally, the dataset contains event data (event, timestamp, type, stablecoin) for significant events that occurred between April 1 2022 to November 1 2022 and that impacted the stablecoins network. One purpose of this dataset is to gain insight into the market behavior and activity at the time of the Terra Luna crash when UST (also known as TerraUSD) lost its 1 USD peg in early May 2022. The price of WLUNA can be used as the proxy for the health of the Terra network during the collapse.",,,,,,TRUE,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ethereum-exchanges,https://snap.stanford.edu/data/ethereum-exchanges.html,"This dataset was provided by Cuneyt Akcora from U Manitoba, Friedhelm Victor from TU Berlin, Murat Kantarcioglu and Yulia Gel from UT Dallas. The Ethereum blockchain stores the transactions that have been executed between roughly 200M account addresses. Ethereum contains two types of account addresses: externally owned and smart contract code accounts. Externally owned accounts (EOA) are controlled by private keys that are managed by real-life entities. Some entities are ordinary users, whereas others are organizations such as blockchain exchanges. There are two types of exchanges; centralized exchanges (CEX), also known as custodial exchanges, manage users�� funds on their behalf, via multiple, centrally controlled EOAs. Decentralized exchanges (DEX) in contrast, typically do not require placing funds in the custody of a single entity, and are typically implemented as smart contract accounts. As exchanges play a major role in blockchain transaction networks, and DEX have gained significant popularity with the advent of Decentralized Finance, understanding these type of addresses and associated transactions has emerged as an important task. This dataset consists of weighted, directed graphs with partially available node labels. Specifically, it consists of token (asset) networks that have been extracted from the Ethereum blockchain between Oct-16-2018 and May-04-2020 and are among the largest during that time frame. It covers the ERC20 assets TUSD, BAT, MANA, MGC, BNT, HEX, AMB, LINK, DAI, HT, AZ, LAMB, SAI, EGT, MXM, USDP, MKR, USDC, NPXS, STORJ, BNB, EBK, WETH, KICK, OMG, KNC, ZRX and ENJ which correspond to the token address field. The data is not anonymized, and can thus be looked up with online block explorers and linked to external information. These networks can be used individually, or jointly, as some nodes may appear in multiple networks. Node labels were obtained in May 2020 from Etherscan.io, a prominent Ethereum block explorer, that curates and maintains address labels. In total, 296 addresses from 149 centralized and decentralized exchange addresses are listed publicly, which are likely used frequently. The dataset also provides address labels (label, address, name, asset) for addresses in the 0.1 depth Alphacore of the stablecoin network.",,,,,,TRUE,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
telecom-graph,,"This dataset is provided by the Global Technology Services department of Huawei Technologies, Co., Ltd. It contains the relationships between users and behaviors in a telecom network. This telecom graph is a good supplement to the online graph collections and can help establish the evaluation standard of modern graph algorithms on telecom networks. The graph consists of 4 types of nodes: user, package, app, cell, and 3 types of edges: user-buy-package, user-use-app, user-live-cell. There are 170K nodes and 50M edges, among which 100K are users.
